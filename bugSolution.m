The solution focuses on correctly using the `compare:` method of `NSDecimalNumber`. This method provides a reliable way to compare decimal numbers, handling potential precision issues accurately.

```objectivec
- (BOOL)areNumbersEqual:(NSDecimalNumber *)num1 and:(NSDecimalNumber *)num2 {
    NSComparisonResult result = [num1 compare:num2];
    return (result == NSOrderedSame);
}
```
This method directly compares the decimal numbers, avoiding potential pitfalls of using other comparison operators that might fail due to precision differences.  Using `compare:` ensures that the comparison is precise and accurate regardless of the decimal numbers' scale and precision.
